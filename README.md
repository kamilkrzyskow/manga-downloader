# manga-downloader
Python scrtipt made to download mangas in bulk from MangaLife.us
<h1>UPDATE</h1>
<br>
I've made a Python3 version of the script one year later, and used a public ftp server to store config setting stored in json and sync them across devices. I didn't know of the .gitignore at the time so it's private as it contains all of my passwords. The newer script is also deprecated, because the website had another redesign. Currently I find it more convinient to read manga online than to download them and read them in bulk.
<h1>Old readme</h1>
<br>Made with Python 2.7.13 + <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup4</a>
<br><br>Development Start Date: November 11th 2017 8PM
<br>Development End Date: December 17th 2017 2PM
<br>Amount of lines of code: ~450Â±70
<br>Hours worked: 15-40
<br><br>-----------------------<br>
Favorites are being saved in the same place where the scripts are.
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br><br>Unfinished stuff:
<ul>
    <li>Whole project
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting code duplicates and redundant code</li>
            <li>Favorites on an ftp</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>FavChk.py
        <ul>
            <li>Run update() on script execution</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dl.py
        <ul>
            <li>error handling</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>And a lot more, but I'm happy with the current end results</li>
</ul>
<br>
I'm planning to redo this project in Python3 with FTP support, because it turned out that copying my favorites file between my phone and pc is harder than I have anticipated
